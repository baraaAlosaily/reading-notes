# Mongo and Mongoose

You can show the differece between noSQL and SQL below:
No.|SQL|NoSQL
---|---|---
1|SQL databases are primarily called as Relational Databases (RDBMS)|NoSQL database are primarily called as non-relational or distributed database.
2|SQL databases are table based databases,SQL databases represent data in form of tables which consists of n number of rows of data|databases are document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores,NoSQL databases are the collection of key-value pair, documents, graph databases or wide-column stores which do not have standard schema definitions which it needs to adhered to.
3|SQL databases have predefined schema|NoSQL databases have dynamic schema for unstructured data.
4|SQL databases are vertically scalable|NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable.
5|SQL databases are scaled by increasing the horse-power of the hardware.|NoSQL databases are scaled by increasing the databases servers in the pool of resources to reduce the load.
5|SQL databases uses SQL ( structured query language ) for defining and manipulating the data, which is very powerful.| NoSQL database, queries are focused on collection of documents. Sometimes it is also called as UnQL (Unstructured Query Language). The syntax of using UnQL varies from database to database.
6|SQL database examples: MySql, Oracle, Sqlite, Postgres and MS-SQL.|NoSQL database examples: MongoDB, BigTable, Redis, RavenDb, Cassandra, Hbase, Neo4j and CouchDb
7|For complex queries: SQL databases are good fit for the complex query intensive environment|For complex queries:|NoSQL databases are not good fit for complex queries. On a high-level, NoSQL don’t have standard interfaces to perform complex queries, and the queries themselves in NoSQL are not as powerful as SQL query language.
8|For the type of data to be stored: SQL databases are not best fit for hierarchical data storage.|NoSQL database fits better for the hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data. NoSQL database are highly preferred for large data set
9|For scalability: In most typical situations, SQL databases are vertically scalable. You can manage increasing load by increasing the CPU, RAM, SSD, etc, on a single server. |For scalability:NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable. You can just add few more servers easily in your NoSQL database infrastructure to handle the large traffic.
10|For high transactional based application: SQL databases are best fit for heavy duty transactional type applications, as it is more stable and promises the atomicity as well as integrity of the data.|For high transactional based application:NoSQL for transactions purpose, it is still not comparable and sable enough in high load and for complex transactional applications.
11|For support: Excellent support are available for all SQL database from their vendors. There are also lot of independent consultations who can help you with SQL database for a very large scale deployments.|For support:NoSQL database you still have to rely on community support, and only limited outside experts are available for you to setup and deploy your large scale NoSQL deployments.
12|For properties: SQL databases emphasizes on ACID properties ( Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation and Durability)|For properties:NoSQL database follows the Brewers CAP theorem ( Consistency, Availability and Partition tolerance )
13|For DB types: On a high-level, we can classify SQL databases as either open-source or close-sourced from commercial vendors.|For DB types:NoSQL databases can be classified on the basis of way of storing data as graph databases, key-value store databases, document store databases, column store database and XML databases.

1. What does SQL stand for?
   Structure Query Language
2. What is a realational database?
   A relational database is a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another.
3. What type of structure does a relational database work with?
   In the relational database model, the data structures -- including data tables, indexes and views -- remain separate from the physical storage, allowing administrators to edit the physical data storage without affecting the logical data structure.
4. What is a ‘schema’?
   The database schema is its structure described in a formal language supported by the database management system (DBMS). The term "schema" refers to the organization of data as a blueprint of how the database is constructed (divided into database tables in the case of relational databases)
5. What is a NoSQL database?

   NoSQL databases are widely used in real-time web applications and big data, because their main advantages are high scalability and high availability.

6. Howo does it work?

NoSQL databases are also the preferred choice of developers, as they naturally lend themselves to an agile development paradigm by rapidly adapting to changing requirements. NoSQL databases allow the data to be stored in ways that are more intuitive and easier to understand, or closer to the way the data is used by applications—with fewer transformations required when storing or retrieving using NoSQL-style APIs. Moreover, NoSQL databases can take full advantage of the cloud to deliver zero downtime.

7. What is inside of a Mongo database?
   Mongo has data stored as documents which are then put into collections. A database can have one or more of these collections that have been formed.
8. Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.
   While MongoDB is more flexible and ensures high and diverse data availability, a SQL Database operates with the ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability) properties and ensures greater reliability of transactions.
9. What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?
   NoSQL databases don’t have the reliability functions which Relational Databases have (basically don’t support ACID). This also means that NoSQL databases offer consistency in performance and scalability
