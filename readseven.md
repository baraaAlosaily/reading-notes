Who is Roy Fielding? Fielding is the man who helped write the first web servers, that sent documents across the internet. Also, he did researches explaining why the web works the way it does.

Why don’t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world? Because the techniques were not designed with concern of that purpose. And because web pages are designed to be understood by people, machines can’t use their data unless it was provided in a language and a format, machines an understand like APIs for example.

What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created? They created the web, being able to talk to any machine anywhere in the world was a primary concern. the HTTP protocol is all about applying verbs to nouns. That means when you go to a web page, the browser does an HTTP GET on the URL you typed in and back comes a web page.

What does a GET do? a GET does what it name implies, it get things through an URL, like getting the text of a site, images, videos.

What does a POST do? POST adds data to a system from another system.

What does PUT do? PUT replaces something from a system by another system.

What does PATCH do? PATCH partially updates the data in a system from another system.
