# Trees 

- Binary Trees
- Binary Search Trees
- K-ary Trees

Common Terminology
- Node - A Tree node is a component which may contain it’s own values, and references to other nodes
- Root - The root is the node at the beginning of the tree
- K - A number that specifies the maximum number of children any node may have in a k-ary tree. In a binary tree, k = 2.
- Left - A reference to one child node, in a binary tree
- Right - A reference to the other child node, in a binary tree
- Edge - The edge in a tree is the link between a parent and child node
- Leaf - A leaf is a node that does not have any children
- Height - The height of a tree is the number of edges from the root to the furthest leaf

Traversing: a tree allows us to search for a node, print out the contents of a tree, and much more!

- There are two categories of traversals when it comes to trees:

Depth First
Breadth First

- Depth First

Depth first traversal is where we prioritize going through the depth (height) of the tree first.

Depth First
Depth first traversal is where we prioritize going through the depth (height) of the tree first. There are multiple ways to carry out depth first traversal, and each method changes the order in which we search/print the root. Here are three methods for depth first traversal:

- Pre-order: root >> left >> right
- In-order: left >> root >> right
- Post-order: left >> right >> root

The most common way to traverse through a tree is to use **recursion**.

Traversal Pseudocode

Pre-Oreder (Psedo)

```
ALGORITHM preOrder(root)

  OUTPUT <-- root.value

  if root.left is not NULL
      preOrder(root.left)

  if root.right is not NULL
      preOrder(root.right)
```

In-order

```
ALGORITHM inOrder(root)
// INPUT <-- root node
// OUTPUT <-- in-order output of tree node's values

    if root.left is not NULL
        inOrder(root.left)

    OUTPUT <-- root.value

    if root.right is not NULL
        inOrder(root.right)
```

Post=order

```
ALGORITHM postOrder(root)
// INPUT <-- root node
// OUTPUT <-- post-order output of tree node's values

    if root.left is not NULL
        postOrder(root.left)

    if root.right is not NULL
        postOrder(root.right)

    OUTPUT <-- root.value
```

Notice the similarities between the three different traversals above. The biggest difference between each of the traversals is when you are looking at **the root node**.

- Pre-order means that the root has to be looked at first. In our case, looking at the root just means that we output its value. When we call preOrder for the first time, the root will be added to the call stack.

## Breadth First

Breadth first traversal iterates through the tree by going through each level of the tree node-by-node.

Traditionally, breadth first traversal uses a queue (instead of the call stack via recursion) to traverse the width/breadth of the tree. Let’s break down the process.


## Binary Tree Vs K-ary Trees

 Trees can have any number of children per node, but Binary Trees restrict the number of children to two (hence our left and right children).

 There is no specific sorting order for a binary tree. Nodes can be added into a binary tree wherever space allows. Here is what a binary tree looks like:

 **K-ary Trees**
If Nodes are able have more than 2 child nodes, we call the tree that contains them a K-ary Tree. In this type of tree we use K to refer to the maximum number of children that each Node is able to have.

- Breadth First Traversal
Traversing a K-ary tree requires a similar approach to the breadth first traversal. We are still pushing nodes into a queue, but we are now moving down a list of children of length k, instead of checking for the presence of a left and a right child.

Pseudocode
This process is very similar to our binary tree traversal, but now we check a list of children instead of a left and right child properties. It should look something like this:
