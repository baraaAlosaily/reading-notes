## Java Primitives versus Objects

There is two type of data in Java:

Primitive|Refernce
---|---
int,Bolean|Interger
`Integer j = 1;          // autoboxing`|`int i = new Integer(1); // unboxing`



- Note:The wrapper classes are immutable (so that their state can't change once the object is constructed) and are final (so that we can't inherit from them).

- Note:The process of converting a primitive type to a reference one is called autoboxing,the opposite process is called unboxing

- Criteria to choose the data type:The decision what object is to be used is based on what application performance we try to achieve, how much available memory we have, the amount of available memory and what default values we should handle.

The defference between primitive type and refernce type with criteria:

def|Primitive|reference
----|----|----
Memory|boolean – 1 bit
byte – 8 bits
short, char – 16 bits
int, float – 32 bits
long, double – 64 bits|Boolean – 128 bits
Byte – 128 bits
Short, Character – 128 bits
Integer, Float – 128 bits
Long, Double – 192 bits
access|Variables of these types live in the stack and hence are accessed fast.|We can see that a single variable of Boolean type occupies as much space as 128 primitive ones, while one Integer variable occupies as much space as four int ones.
location|primitive types live in the stack|the reference types live in the heap

## What is the exception in java

* Definition: An exception is an event, which occurs during the execution of a program, that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions.

* Explaination:When an error occurs within a method, the method creates an object and hands it off to the runtime system. The object, called an exception object, contains information about the error, including its type and the state of the program when the error occurred. Creating an exception object and handing it to the runtime system is called throwing an exception.

---|---
After a method throws an exception, the runtime system attempts to find something to handle it. The set of possible "somethings" to handle the exception is the ordered list of methods that had been called to get to the method where the error occurred. The list of methods is known as the call stack |The exception handler chosen is said to catch the exception. If the runtime system exhaustively searches all the methods on the call stack without finding an appropriate exception handler, as shown in the next figure, the runtime system (and, consequently, the program) terminates.

### The Catch or Specify Requirement
1. The try Block
The first step in constructing an exception handler is to enclose the code that might throw an exception within a try block.

syntax:

```
try {
    code
}
catch and finally blocks . . .
```

2. The catch Blocks
You associate exception handlers with a try block by providing one or more catch blocks directly after the try block. No code can be between the end of the try block and the beginning of the first catch block.

syntax:

```
try {

} catch (ExceptionType name) {

} catch (ExceptionType name) {

}
```

3. The finally Block
4. The try-with-resources Statement


Valid Java programming language code must honor the Catch or Specify Requirement. This means that code that might throw certain exceptions must be enclosed by either of the following:

- A try statement that catches the exception. The try must provide a handler for the exception, as described in Catching and Handling Exceptions.
- A method that specifies that it can throw the exception. The method must provide a throws clause that lists the exception, as described in Specifying the Exceptions Thrown by a Method.

### The Three Kinds of Exceptions
1. The first kind of exception is the checked exception.
2. The second kind of exception is the error.
3. The third kind of exception is the runtime exception

### Catching and Handling Exceptions
Example:(and you can check the description or discution below)
 
```
// Note: This class will not compile yet.
import java.io.*;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class ListOfNumbers {

    private List<Integer> list;
    private static final int SIZE = 10;

    public ListOfNumbers () {
        list = new ArrayList<Integer>(SIZE);
        for (int i = 0; i < SIZE; i++) {
            list.add(new Integer(i));
        }
    }

    public void writeList() {
	// The FileWriter constructor throws IOException, which must be caught.
        PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(new FileWriter("OutFile.txt"));

        for (int i = 0; i < SIZE; i++) {
            // The get(int) method throws IndexOutOfBoundsException, which must be caught.
            out.println("Value at: " + i + " = " + list.get(i));
        }
        out.close();
    }
}
```
The first line in boldface is a call to a constructor. The constructor initializes an output stream on a file. If the file cannot be opened, the constructor throws an IOException. The second boldface line is a call to the ArrayList class's get method, which throws an IndexOutOfBoundsException if the value of its argument is too small (less than 0) or too large (more than the number of elements currently contained by the ArrayList).

If you try to compile the ListOfNumbers class, the compiler prints an error message about the exception thrown by the FileWriter constructor. However, it does not display an error message about the exception thrown by get. The reason is that the exception thrown by the constructor, IOException, is a checked exception, and the one thrown by the get method, IndexOutOfBoundsException, is an unchecked exception.

## Scanning 

Objects of type Scanner are useful for breaking down formatted input into tokens and translating individual tokens according to their data type.
