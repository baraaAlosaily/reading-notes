# CSS Transforms, Transitions, and Animations

## CSS Transforms:

- Transform Syntax
  With CSS3 came new ways to position and alter elements. Now general layout techniques can be revisited with alternative ways to size, position, and change elements. All of these new techniques are made possible by the transform property.

The transform property comes in two different settings, two-dimensional and three-dimensional. Each of these come with their own individual properties and values.

Within this lesson we’ll take a look at both two-dimensional and three-dimensional transforms. Generally speaking, browser support for the transform property isn’t great, but it is getting better every day. For the best support vendor prefixes are encouraged, however you may need to download the nightly version of Chrome to see all of these transforms in action.

```
div {
  -webkit-transform: scale(1.5);
     -moz-transform: scale(1.5);
       -o-transform: scale(1.5);
          transform: scale(1.5);
```

- 2D Transforms

The transform property accepts a handful of different values. The rotate value provides the ability to rotate an element from 0 to 360 degrees. Using a positive value will rotate an element clockwise, and using a negative value will rotate the element counterclockwise. The default point of rotation is the center of the element, 50% 50%, both horizontally and vertically. Later we will discuss how you can change this default point of rotation.

Example:

```
.box-1 {
  transform: rotate(20deg);
}
.box-2 {
  transform: rotate(-55deg);
}
```

### Combining Transforms

It is common for multiple transforms to be used at once, rotating and scaling the size of an element at the same time for example. In this event multiple transforms can be combined together. To combine transforms, list the transform values within the transform property one after the other without the use of commas.

### Perspective

In order for three-dimensional transforms to work the elements need a perspective from which to transform. The perspective for each element can be thought of as a vanishing point, similar to that which can be seen in three-dimensional drawings

### 3D Transforms

Working with two-dimensional transforms we are able to alter elements on the horizontal and vertical axes, however there is another axis along which we can transform elements. Using three-dimensional transforms we can change elements on the z axis, giving us control of depth as well as length and width.

### Transform Style

On occasion three-dimensional transforms will be applied on an element that is nested within a parent element which is also being transformed. In this event, the nested, transformed elements will not appear in their own three-dimensional space. To allow nested elements to transform in their own three-dimensional plane use the transform-style property with the preserve-3d value.

The transform-style property needs to be placed on the parent element, above any nested transforms. The preserve-3d value allows the transformed children elements to appear in their own three-dimensional plane while the flat value forces the transformed children elements to lie flat on the two-dimensional plane.

## Transitions & Animations

### Transitions

As mentioned, for a transition to take place, an element must have a change in state, and different styles must be identified for each state. The easiest way for determining styles for different states is by using the :hover, :focus, :active, and :target pseudo-classes.

There are four transition related properties in total, including transition-property, transition-duration, transition-timing-function, and transition-delay. Not all of these are required to build a transition, with the first three are the most popular.

In the example below the box will change its background color over the course of 1 second in a linear fashion

Example:

```
.box {
  background: #2db34a;
  transition-property: background;
  transition-duration: 1s;
  transition-timing-function: linear;
}
.box:hover {
  background: #ff7b29;
}
```

One evolution with CSS3 was the ability to write behaviors for transitions and animations. Front end developers have been asking for the ability to design these interactions within HTML and CSS, without the use of JavaScript or Flash, for years. Now their wish has come true.

With CSS3 transitions you have the potential to alter the appearance and behavior of an element whenever a state change occurs, such as when it is hovered over, focused on, active, or targeted.

Animations within CSS3 allow the appearance and behavior of an element to be altered in multiple keyframes. Transitions provide a change from one state to another, while animations can set multiple points of transition upon different keyframes.

Vendor Prefixes
The code above, as with the rest of the code samples in this lesson, are not vendor prefixed. This is intentionally un-prefixed in the interest of keeping the code snippet small and comprehensible. For the best support across all browsers, use vendor prefixes.

For reference, the prefixed version of the code above would look like the following.

-moz-transition-timing-function: linear;
-o-transition-timing-function: linear;
transition-timing-function: linear;
}
.box:hover {
background: #ff7b29;
}

Transitional Property
The transition-property property determines exactly what properties will be altered in conjunction with the other transitional properties. By default, all of the properties within an element’s different states will be altered upon change. However, only the properties identified within the transition-property value will be affected by any transitions.

In the example above, the background property is identified in the transition-property value. Here the background property is the only property that will change over the duration of 1 second in a linear fashion. Any other properties included when changing an element’s state, but not included within the transition-property value, will not receive the transition behaviors as set by the transition-duration or transition-timing-function properties.

If multiple properties need to be transitioned they may be comma separated within the transition-property value. Additionally, the keyword value all may be used to transition all properties of an element.

Transition Property Demo

Transitional Properties
It is important to note, not all properties may be transitioned, only properties that have an identifiable halfway point. Colors, font sizes, and the alike may be transitioned from one value to another as they have recognizable values in-between one another. The display property, for example, may not be transitioned as it does not have any midpoint. A handful of the more popular transitional properties include the following.

background-colorbackground-positionborder-colorborder-widthborder-spacingbottomclipcolorcropfont-sizefont-weightheightleftletter-spacingline-heightmarginmax-heightmax-widthmin-heightmin-widthopacityoutline-coloroutline-offsetoutline-widthpaddingrighttext-indenttext-shadowtopvertical-alignvisibilitywidthword-spacingz-index
Transition Duration
The duration in which a transition takes place is set using the transition-duration property. The value of this property can be set using general timing values, including seconds (s) and milliseconds (ms). These timing values may also come in fractional measurements, .2s for example.

When transitioning multiple properties you can set multiple durations, one for each property. As with the transition-property property value, multiple durations can be declared using comma separated values. The order of these values when identifying individual properties and durations does matter. For example, the first property identified within the transition-property property will match up with the first time identified within the transition-duration property, and so forth.

If multiple properties are being transitioned with only one duration value declared, that one value will be the duration of all the transitioned properties.

```
.box {
background: #2db34a;
border-radius: 6px;
transition-property: background, border-radius;
transition-duration: .2s, 1s;
transition-timing-function: linear;
}
.box:hover {
background: #ff7b29;
border-radius: 50%;
}
```

Transition Duration Demo

Transition Timing
The transition-timing-function property is used to set the speed in which a transition will move. Knowing the duration from the transition-duration property a transition can have multiple speeds within a single duration. A few of the more popular keyword values for the transition-timing-function property include linear, ease-in, ease-out, and ease-in-out.

The linear keyword value identifies a transition moving in a constant speed from one state to another. The ease-in value identifies a transition that starts slowly and speeds up throughout the transition, while the ease-out value identifies a transition that starts quickly and slows down throughout the transition. The ease-in-out value identifies a transition that starts slowly, speeds up in the middle, then slows down again before ending.

Each timing function has a cubic-bezier curve behind it, which can be specifically set using the cubic-bezier(x1, y1, x2, y2) value. Additional values include step-start, step-stop, and a uniquely identified steps(number_of_steps, direction) value.

When transitioning multiple properties, you can identify multiple timing functions. These timing function values, as with other transition property values, may be declared as comma separated values.

```
.box {
background: #2db34a;
border-radius: 6px;
transition-property: background, border-radius;
transition-duration: .2s, 1s;
transition-timing-function: linear, ease-in;
}
.box:hover {
background: #ff7b29;
border-radius: 50%;
}
```

Transition Timing Demo

Transition Delay
On top of declaring the transition property, duration, and timing function, you can also set a delay with the transition-delay property. The delay sets a time value, seconds or milliseconds, that determines how long a transition should be stalled before executing. As with all other transition properties, to delay numerous transitions, each delay can be declared as comma separated values.

```
.box {
background: #2db34a;
border-radius: 6px
transition-property: background, border-radius;
transition-duration: .2s, 1s;
transition-timing-function: linear, ease-in;
transition-delay: 0s, 1s;
}
.box:hover {
background: #ff7b29;
border-radius: 50%;
}
```

### Shorthand Transitions

Declaring every transition property individually can become quite intensive, especially with vendor prefixes. Fortunately there is a shorthand property, transition, capable of supporting all of these different properties and values. Using the transition value alone, you can set every transition value in the order of transition-property, transition-duration, transition-timing-function, and lastly transition-delay. Do not use commas with these values unless you are identifying numerous transitions.

To set numerous transitions at once, set each individual group of transition values, then use a comma to separate each additional group of transition values.

```
.box {
  background: #2db34a;
  border-radius: 6px;
  transition: background .2s linear, border-radius 1s ease-in 1s;
}
.box:hover {
  color: #ff7b29;
  border-radius: 50%;
}
```

### Animations

Transitions do a great job of building out visual interactions from one state to another, and are perfect for these kinds of single state changes. However, when more control is required, transitions need to have multiple states. In return, this is where animations pick up where transitions leave off.

Animations Keyframes
To set multiple points at which an element should undergo a transition, use the @keyframes rule. The @keyframes rule includes the animation name, any animation breakpoints, and the properties intended to be animated.

```
@keyframes slide {
  0% {
    left: 0;
    top: 0;
  }
  50% {
    left: 244px;
    top: 100px;
  }
  100% {
    left: 488px;
    top: 0;
  }
}
```

Vendor Prefixing the Keyframe Rule
The @keyframes rule must be vendor prefixed, just like all of the other transition and animation properties. The vendor prefixes for the @keyframes rule look like the following:

@-moz-keyframes@-o-keyframes@-webkit-keyframes
