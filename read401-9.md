## The HTTP Request Lifecycle

 HTTP methods

### Step 1: Local Processing

1. browser extracts the "scheme"/protocol (we have established
that this will be HTTP), host (www.example.com),
and optional port number, resource path, and query strings that are specified in the form`
<protocol>://<host><:optional port>/<path/to/resource><?query>` . An example is `|http|://|www.example.com||:5000||/mainpage||?query=param&query2=param2|`

2. Now that the browser has the intended hostname for the request, it needs to resolve an IP address1. The browser will then look through its own cache of recently requested URLs, the operating system’s cache of recent queries, your router’s cache, and your DNS cache.

### Step 2: Resolve an IP

1. If the cache lookup fails (we will assume it does), your browser fires off a DNS request using UDP3. The DNS request contains the preconfigured IP for your DNS server and your return IP in its header. The hostname for which you are trying to resolve an IP is in the request’s "Question" section. UDP is a lightweight protocol, but the tradeoff is that it offers no guarantees in terms of delivery, and there is no acknowledgement other than a response being sent and received.

2. Your request will now have to travel many network devices to reach its target DNS server. Whenever the packet hits a piece of networking equipment, the device uses a routing table to determine which other device it is connected to that is most likely situated along the shortest path to the destination.4

3. Once your request arrives at your configured DNS server, the server looks for the address associated with the requested hostname. If it finds one, it sends a response. If, on the other hand, the DNS server you have targeted cannot locate the given hostname, it passes the request along to another DNS server it is configured to defer to. This happens recursively until the address is found, or an "authoritative" nameserver is hit. If an address for the given domain cannot be resolved, the server responds with a failure and your browser returns an error.

### Step 3: Establish a TCP Connection

TCP uses segments to determine whether the receiving host is ready to receive the data. When the sending TCP wants to establish connections, TCP sends a segment that is called a SYN to the TCP protocol on the receiving host. The receiving TCP returns a segment that is called an ACK to acknowledge the successful receipt of the segment. The sending TCP sends another ACK segment, then proceeds to send the data. This exchange of control information is referred to as a three-way handshake.

### Step 4: Send an HTTP Request

Use the HTTP Request Step to perform a single HTTP(S) request. After successful execution this Step will create the following Variables: Body, Headers, StatusCode, ResponseTime, ReasonPhrase. This Step supports Verifications to make sure the HTTP Response is the same as the expected.

### Step 5:Tearing and clean up

Once the response has been fully delivered, the client sends a FIN packet at the TCP level, to which the server responds with an ACK, and then generally sends a FIN of its own, which the client responds to with its own ACK signal. The client then waits for a brief timeout, during which it cannot accept new connections, to prevent delayed packets from previous connections arriving during subsequent activities on the port. This four way handshake12 signals the end of the TCP connection.

## Java HTTP Request example

1. HttpUrlConnection
The HttpUrlConnection class allows us to perform basic HTTP requests without the use of any additional libraries. All the classes that we need are part of the java.net package. The disadvantages of using this method are that the code can be more cumbersome than other HTTP libraries and that it does not provide more advanced functionalities such as dedicated methods for adding headers or authentication.

2. Creating a Request
We can create an HttpUrlConnection instance using the openConnection() method of the URL class. Note that this method only creates a connection object but doesn't establish the connection yet.

The HttpUrlConnection class is used for all types of requests by setting the requestMethod attribute to one of the values: GET, POST, HEAD, OPTIONS, PUT, DELETE, TRACE.

```
URL url = new URL("http://example.com");
HttpURLConnection con = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();
con.setRequestMethod("GET");
```

4. Adding Request Parameters
If we want to add parameters to a request, we have to set the doOutput property to true, then write a String of the form param1=value¶m2=value to the OutputStream of the HttpUrlConnection instance:

```
Map<String, String> parameters = new HashMap<>();
parameters.put("param1", "val");

con.setDoOutput(true);
DataOutputStream out = new DataOutputStream(con.getOutputStream());
out.writeBytes(ParameterStringBuilder.getParamsString(parameters));
out.flush();
out.close();
```

5. Setting Request Headers
Adding headers to a request can be achieved by using the setRequestProperty() method

6. Configuring Timeouts
HttpUrlConnection class allows setting the connect and read timeouts. These values define the interval of time to wait for the connection to the server to be established or data to be available for reading.

7. Handling Cookies
To read the cookies from a response, we can retrieve the value of the Set-Cookie header and parse it to a list of HttpCookie objects:

```
String cookiesHeader = con.getHeaderField("Set-Cookie");
List<HttpCookie> cookies = HttpCookie.parse(cookiesHeader);
```

8. Handling Redirects
We can enable or disable automatically following redirects for a specific connection by using the setInstanceFollowRedirects() method with true or false parameter:

```
con.setInstanceFollowRedirects(false);
```

9. Reading the Response
Reading the response of the request can be done by parsing the InputStream of the HttpUrlConnection instance.

10. Reading the Response on Failed Requests
If the request fails, trying to read the InputStream of the HttpUrlConnection instance won't work. Instead, we can consume the stream provided by HttpUrlConnection.getErrorStream().

11. Building the Full Response
It's not possible to get the full response representation using the HttpUrlConnection instance.
