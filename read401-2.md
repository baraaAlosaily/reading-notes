# Arrays, Loops,Imports

## A Guide to Java Loops

* Intro 
looping is a feature which facilitates the execution of a set of instructions until the controlling Boolean-expression evaluates to false. 

Here are the type of loops that we will use in Java
1. For loop: A for loop is a control structure that allows us to repeat certain operations by incrementing and evaluating a loop counter.

Syntax

```
for (initialization; Boolean-expression; step) 
  statement;
```
We can also labeled for loop by using break and continue (see the example below)

```
for (int i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
    if (i == 1)
      continue;
    bb: for (int j = 1; j <= 3; j++) {
        if (i == 2 && j == 2) {
            break aa;
        }
        System.out.println(i + " " + j);
    }
}
```
Enhanced for loop (Java 5)

syntax 
```
for(Type item : items)
  statement;
```

We just need to declaration two things

1. The handle for an element we're currently iterating over
2. The source array/collection we're iterating

Example:
```
int[] intArr = { 0,1,2,3,4 }; 
for (int num : intArr) {
    System.out.println("Enhanced for-each loop: i = " + num);
}
```
* Iterable.forEach()
Since Java 8, we can leverage for-each loops in a slightly different way. We now have a dedicated forEach() method in the Iterable interface that accepts a lambda expression representing an action we want to perform.

Syntax

```
default void forEach(Consumer<? super T> action) {
    Objects.requireNonNull(action);
    for (T t : this) {
        action.accept(t);
    }
}
```
2. While
It repeats a statement or a block of statements while its controlling Boolean-expression is true.

Syntax

```
while (Boolean-expression) 
    statement;
```
Example
```
int i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
    System.out.println("While loop: i = " + i++);
}
```
3. Do while 

The do-while loop works just like the while loop except for the fact that the first condition evaluation happens after the first iteration of the loop.

Syntax
```
do {
    statement;
} while (Boolean-expression);
```

Example

```
int i = 0;
do {
    System.out.println("Do-While loop: i = " + i++);
} while (i < 5);
```


## Packages and import 

* Java classes can be grouped to gether in packages but what is the package?A package name is the same as the directory (folder) name which contains the .java files.

* Package declaration 
 
First step:The first statement, other than comments, in a Java source file, must be the package declaration.

Second step: Following the optional package declaration, you can have import statements, which allow you to specify classes from other packages that can be referenced without qualifying them with their package.

* Package declartion syntax

You can import package by follow those steps:
1. Package statment (optional).
2. Imports (optional).
3. Class or interface definitions.

```
// This source file must be Drawing.java in the illustration directory.

package illustration;

import java.awt.*;

public class Drawing {
    . . .
}
```
* Imports: three options

The JOptionPane class is in the swing package, which is located in the javax package. The wildcard character (*) is used to specify that all classes with that package are available to your program. This is the most common programming style.

Example:
```
import javax.swing.*;  // Make all classes visible altho only one is used.

class ImportTest {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, "Hi");
        System.exit(0);
    }
}
```
Classes can be specified explicitly on import instead of using the wildcard character.

```
import javax.swing.JOptionPane;  // Make a single class visible.

class ImportTest {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, "Hi");
        System.exit(0);
    }
}
```

Alternately we can the fully qualified class name without an import.
```
class ImportTest {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        javax.swing.JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, "Hi");
        System.exit(0);
    }
}
```

* common import

```

import java.awt.*;	Common GUI elements.
import java.awt.event.*;	The most common GUI event listeners.
import javax.swing.*;	More common GUI elements. Note "javax".
import java.util.*;	Data structures (Collections), time, Scanner, etc classes.
import java.io.*;	Input-output classes.
import java.text.*;	Some formatting classes.
import java.util.regex.*;	Regular expression classes.
```
