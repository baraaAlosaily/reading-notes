# OO Design

## The First 5 Principles of Object Oriented Design

Adopting these practices can also contribute to avoiding code smells, refactoring code, and Agile or Adaptive software development.

**SOLID stands for:**

S - Single-responsiblity Principle
O - Open-closed Principle
L - Liskov Substitution Principle
I - Interface Segregation Principle
D - Dependency Inversion Principle

1. Single-Responsibility Principle
A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job.

2. Open-Closed Principle
Objects or entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.

3. Liskov Substitution Principle
Let q(x) be a property provable about objects of x of type T. Then q(y) should be provable for objects y of type S where S is a subtype of T.

4. Interface Segregation Principle
A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn’t use, or clients shouldn’t be forced to depend on methods they do not use.

5. Dependency Inversion Principle

Entities must depend on abstractions, not on concretions. It states that the high-level module must not depend on the low-level module, but they should depend on abstractions.

**Conclusion**

In this article, you were presented with the five principles of SOLID Code. Projects that adhere to SOLID principles can be shared with collaborators, extended, modified, tested, and refactored with fewer complications.
