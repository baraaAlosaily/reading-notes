## ES6 Classes
### Inheritance

1. JavaScript only has one construct: objects.

2. Each object has a private property which holds a link to another object called its prototype.

3. That prototype object has a prototype of its own, and so on until an object is reached with null as its prototype.

4. By definition, null has no prototype, and acts as the final link in this prototype chain.

5. Nearly all objects in JavaScript are instances of Object which sits on the top of a prototype chain.

6. A function's this keyword behaves a little differently in JavaScript compared to other languages.

7. The behavior of this in classes and functions is similar, since classes are functions under the hood. But there are some differences and caveats.

```
class Example {
  constructor() {
    const proto = Object.getPrototypeOf(this);
    console.log(Object.getOwnPropertyNames(proto));
  }
  first() {}
  second() {}
  static third() {}
}
new Example(); // ['constructor', 'first', 'second']
```
Constructor: When a function is used as a constructor (with the new keyword), its this is bound to the new object being constructed.
Classes
Classes are a template for creating objects. They encapsulate data with code to work on that data.

Classes in JS are built on prototypes but also have some syntax and semantics that are not shared with ES5 class-like semantics.

Class declarations
```
class Rectangle {
  constructor(height, width) {
    this.height = height;
    this.width = width;
  }
}
Hoisting
const p = new Rectangle(); // ReferenceError

class Rectangle {}
```
