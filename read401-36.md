# Cognito

The Amplify Auth category provides an interface for authenticating a user. Behind the scenes, it provides the necessary authorization to the other Amplify categories. It comes with default, built-in support for Amazon Cognito User Pool and Identity Pool. The Amplify CLI helps you to create and configure the auth category with an authentication provider.


## Configure Auth Category

To start provisioning auth resources in the backend, go to your project directory and execute the command:

```
amplify add auth
```

Enter the following when prompted:

```
? Do you want to use the default authentication and security configuration?
    `Default configuration`
? How do you want users to be able to sign in?
    `Username`
? Do you want to configure advanced settings?
    `No, I am done.`
```

Install Amplify Libraries

Add the following dependency to your app's build.gradle along with others you added above in Prerequisites and click "Sync Now" when prompted:

```

dependencies {
    implementation 'com.amplifyframework:aws-auth-cognito:1.24.0'
}

```


Check the current auth session

We can now check the current auth session.

For testing purposes, you can run this from your MainActivity's onCreate method.

```
Amplify.Auth.fetchAuthSession(
    result -> Log.i("AmplifyQuickstart", result.toString()),
    error -> Log.e("AmplifyQuickstart", error.toString())
);
```
