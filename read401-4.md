# OOP

## What Is an Object?
- Object consist of consist of state and related behavior
-  An object stores its state in fields (variables in some programming languages)
-  Object behavior through methods (functions in some programming languages)
- Methods operate on an object's internal state and serve as the primary mechanism for object-to-object communication.
- Hiding internal state and requiring all interaction to be performed through an object's methods is known as data encapsulation â€” a fundamental principle of object-oriented programming.

Benifits of using objects:
1. Modularity
2. Information-hiding
3. Code re-use
4. Pluggability and debugging ease
