# OOP

## What Is an Object?
- Object consist of consist of state and related behavior
-  An object stores its state in fields (variables in some programming languages)
-  Object behavior through methods (functions in some programming languages)
- Methods operate on an object's internal state and serve as the primary mechanism for object-to-object communication.
- Hiding internal state and requiring all interaction to be performed through an object's methods is known as data encapsulation â€” a fundamental principle of object-oriented programming.

Benifits of using objects:
1. Modularity
2. Information-hiding
3. Code re-use
4. Pluggability and debugging ease

## What is the class 

A class is a blueprint or prototype from which objects are created. This section defines a class that models the state and behavior of a real-world object. It intentionally focuses on the basics, showing how even a simple class can cleanly model state and behavior.

### Declaring Classes

```
class MyClass {
    // field, constructor, and 
    // method declarations
}
```
- This is a class declaration. The class body (the area between the braces) contains all the code that provides for the life cycle of the objects created from the class: constructors for initializing new objects, declarations for the fields that provide the state of the class and its objects, and methods to implement the behavior of the class and its objects.

In general, class declarations can include these components, in order:

1. Modifiers such as public, private, and a number of others that you will encounter later. (However, note that the private modifier can only be applied to Nested Classes.)
2. The class name, with the initial letter capitalized by convention.
3. The name of the class's parent (superclass), if any, preceded by the keyword extends. A class can only extend (subclass) one parent.
4. A comma-separated list of interfaces implemented by the class, if any, preceded by the keyword implements. A class can implement more than one interface.
5. The class body, surrounded by braces, {}.

### Summary of Class and Objects:

A class declaration names the class and encloses the class body between braces. The class name can be preceded by modifiers. The class body contains fields, methods, and constructors for the class. A class uses fields to contain state information and uses methods to implement behavior. Constructors that initialize a new instance of a class use the name of the class and look like methods without a return type.

You control access to classes and members in the same way: by using an access modifier such as public in their declaration.

You specify a class variable or a class method by using the static keyword in the member's declaration. A member that is not declared as static is implicitly an instance member. Class variables are shared by all instances of a class and can be accessed through the class name as well as an instance reference. Instances of a class get their own copy of each instance variable, which must be accessed through an instance reference.

Instance variables and methods that are accessible to code outside of the class that they are declared in can be referred to by using a qualified name. The qualified name of an instance variable looks like this:
```
objectReference.variableName
```
The qualified name of a method looks like this:
```
objectReference.methodName(argumentList)
```
or:
```
objectReference.methodName()
```

Decimals

How do Decimal Numbers work?

1. Every digit in a decimal number has a "position", and the decimal point helps us to know which position
2. The position just to the left of the point is the "Ones" position.
3. Every position further to the left is 10 times bigger, and every position further to the right is 10 times smaller

Bases

The Decimal Number System is also called "Base 10", because it is based on the number 10

Binary Number System

A Binary Number is made up of only 0s and 1s.

Example of a Binary Number
There is no 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 or 9 in Binary!

Binary numbers have many uses in mathematics and beyond.
