# Link List

Today wil go through three topics:
1. The definitions that related to link list
2. And we goes through something deeper inside this topic 

 - Definition: A Linked List is a sequence of Nodes that are connected/linked to each other,each Node references the next Node in the link.

 There are two types of Linked List:-
 1. Singly 
 2. Doubly

 The most important termonology that you will need to before start reading:
 1. Linked List - A data structure that contains nodes that links/points to the next node in the list.
2. Singly - Singly refers to the number of references the node has. A Singly linked list means that there is only one reference, and the reference points to the Next node in a linked list.
3. Doubly - Doubly refers to there being two (double) references within the node. A Doubly linked list means that there is a reference to both the Next and Previous node.
4. Node - Nodes are the individual items/links that live in a linked list. Each node contains the data for each link.
5. Next - Each node contains a property called Next. This property contains the reference to the next node.
Head - The Head is a reference of type Node to the first node in a linked list.
6. Current - The Current is a reference of type Node to the node that is currently being looked at. When traversing, you create a new Current variable at the Head to guarantee you are starting from the beginning of the linked list.

### Traversal:
1- The best way to approach a traversal is through the use of a while() loop. This allows us to continually check that the Next node in the list is not null
2- When traversing through a linked list, the Current variable will tell us where exactly in the linked list we are and will allow us to move/traverse forward until we hit the end.
3- Traversal Big O
3.1 The Big O of time for Includes would be O(n). This is because, at its worse case, the node we are looking for will be the very last node in the linked list. n represents the number of nodes in the linked list.

3.2 The Big O of space for Includes would be O(1). This is because there is no additional space being used than what is already given to us with the linked list input.

### Add O(1)

Here are the required steps to add a new node with an O(1) efficiency.

1. The values passed in as arguments into the Add() method will define what the value of the Node will be.
2. newNode.Next by default is set to null. We want to set newNode.Next property to the same location that the Head node is pointing towards. Because Head is just a reference type, we will be assigning it to the same allocation in memory as the node it is pointing too. In this case, it’s Node1.
3. At this point in the program we now “technically” have newNode at the beginning of the linked list, but we are not done yet. We now have to re-assign where Head is pointing too. Since Node1 is no longer the first node in the list, we want to re-assign Head to point at newNode.

The difference between Linear structure and non-leaner structure

Memory allocation in static versus dynamic data structures

- The fundamental difference between arrays and linked lists is that arrays are static data structures, while linked lists are dynamic data structures.
- A static data structure needs all of its resources to be allocated when the structure is created; this means that even if the structure was to grow or shrink in size and elements were to be added or removed, it still always needs a given size and amount of memory.

-Adding or removing a node with a linked list becomes as simple as rearranging some pointers, rather than copying over the elements of an array

- Singly linked lists are the simplest type of linked list, based solely on the fact that they only go in one direction. There is a single track that we can traverse the list in; we start at the head node, and traverse from the root until the last node, which will end at an empty null value.
-if we wanted to be able to hop between one node and the node previous without having to go back to the very beginning of the list, a doubly linked list would be a better data structure than a singly linked list.

## Big O
- Big O is really all over and omnipresent within computer science.
- There are two major points to consider when thinking about:
1. how an algorithm performs: 
2. how much time it requires at runtime given how much time and memory it needs.

One way to think about Big O notation is a way to express the amount of time that a function, action, or algorithm takes to run based on how many elements we pass to that function.

- An O(1) function takes constant time, which is to say that it doesn’t matter how many elements we have, or how huge our input is: it’ll always take the same amount of time and memory to run our algorithm.
- An O(n) function is linear, which means that as our input grows (from ten numbers, to ten thousand, to ten million), the space and time that we need to run that algorithm grows linearly.
